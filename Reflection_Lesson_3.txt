  When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
  local?

      It's good for collaborations so we could all work on the project simultaneously
      while staying up-to-date with the changes in real time.

  Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
  automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

      So I could focus on what I'm working on by selectively pulling only the files I
      need on my local directory instead of the whole project.

  Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
  use one instead of another?

      Forks: Use when the repository you want to work on is on GitHub
      Clones: Use when you want to work on a remote repository on your pc
      Branches: Use when working on small changes you wouldn't want to directly affect
                the core project

  What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
  stored locally?

      I get to work offline without incorporating the changes made by others on GitHub.

  How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
  and what would be harder?

      Sending files back and forth. Using Git and GitHub would be a lot easier ofc.

  When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
  master?  What benefits does each approach have?

      For experimental changes or features I want to incorporate to the code, I'd rather
      use branches. But for changes that directly affect the core code, I'd use the main
      branch master to avoid complicating things.
